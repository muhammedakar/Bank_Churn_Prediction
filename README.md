# Bank Churn Prediction

#### Dataset Story:
This dataset contains demographic and banking-related information of customers of a bank. This dataset can be used to understand the customer base of the bank and to predict customer churn. Customer churn is an important topic for banks to understand and address in order to retain customers and reduce customer loss. Analyzing this dataset and developing a machine learning model to predict churned customers based on various factors can be valuable for the bank's customer retention efforts.

#### Business Problem:
Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a bank customer will churn or not.
